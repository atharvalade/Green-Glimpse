**Machine Learning Project with Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

**Overview**

This GitHub repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on training and evaluating a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using Python. The project aims to demonstrate various aspects of the machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and making predictions.

**Technologies and Tools Used**

Python: The project is written in Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language for data science and machine learning.
Libraries:
numpy: Used for numerical operations and data manipulation.
pandas: Utilized for data handling and analysis using DataFrames.
matplotlib: Employed for creating data visualizations and plots.
seaborn: Used for enhanced data visualization with Seaborn's pairplot function.
scikit-learn: Leveraged for machine learning tasks, particularly SVM model creation and evaluation.
Machine Learning: The core focus of the project is on machine learning techniques, specifically the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification tasks.
Data: The project utilizes a dataset from the file 'Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv' to train and evaluate the SVM model. Data preprocessing and analysis are performed to prepare the dataset for model training.
Project Objectives

**The main objectives of this machine learning project are as follows:**

Data Preprocessing: The project begins by loading the dataset and performing data preprocessing, including data selection, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Data Visualization: The dataset is visualized using Seaborn's pairplot function, providing insights into the relationships between different features.
Machine Learning Model Training: The project trains an SVM classifier using the scikit-learn library. The model is trained on selected features and evaluated for accuracy.
Model Evaluation: The project assesses the model's accuracy and error percentage using a validation set. It also visualizes the model's performance by separating test data into two groups based on predicted labels.
Future Predictions: The trained model is used to make predictions about an unknown data point.
Presentation: The project includes a presentation component, requiring the creation of slides that describe the dataset, display histograms of data, provide visualizations of data and the model, and showcase model accuracy and predictions.
Submission: Before the presentation, the presentation slides, Jupyter Notebook, and a PDF version of the Jupyter Notebook must be submitted.
